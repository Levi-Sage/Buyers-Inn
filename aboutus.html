            <h1>About Buyers Inn</h1>
            <p class="intro">
                Buyers Inn is a smart and user-friendly platform designed to help users compare prices across different food delivery services like Zomato and Swiggy — all in one place.
            </p>
            <h2>What is Buyers Inn?</h2>
            <p>
                Our platform acts as a digital assistant for cost-conscious users. Whether you're ordering lunch at the office or dinner at home, Buyers Inn quickly fetches live data from popular food delivery platforms, compares the prices of your chosen items, and shows you the best deal instantly.
            </p>

            <h2>Why We Built It</h2>
            <p>
                In today’s fast-paced life, we tend to spend more without realizing how prices vary across platforms. Buyers Inn solves that by offering:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>✔ Real-time price comparison</li>
                <li>✔ Intuitive and mobile-friendly interface</li>
                <li>✔ Saves both time and money</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Our Goal</h2>
            <p>
                We aim to become the go-to tool for every food delivery user. In future updates, we plan to include rating comparison, delivery speed analysis, and personalized recommendations based on user preferences.
